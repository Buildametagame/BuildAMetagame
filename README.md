# BuildAMetagame
The Repository for the BAM mod for Pokemon Showdown. If you want to add this on your server you will have to edit your client to add sprites and update the team builder.


Add the following to formats.js:

	{
		name: "BAM",
		section: "Other Metagames",

		ruleset: ['Sleep Clause Mod', 'Species Clause'],
		banlist: ['Ubers','OU','UU','RU','NU','PU','NF','LC','CAP'] 
	},
